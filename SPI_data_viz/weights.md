## Customize Weights

**In this tool, users can adjust weights placed on dimensions or pillars to put greater emphasis on certain areas.**

The statistical performance indicators have a three level structure, and the overall score is formed by sequentially aggregating each level.  The overall score is a weighted average of the underlying pillars, dimensions, and indicators.  See more details in the [SPI technical paper](https://worldbank.github.io/SPI/measuring-the-statistical-performance-of-countries-an-overview-of-the-statistical-performance-indicators-and-index.html#spi-index-methodology).  This tool allows users to change weights assigned to the pillars and dimensions of the SPI.

**The user can change these weights using the scrollbar.**  In order adjust the weights of a pillar or dimension, the user can use the corresponding toggle in the bar on the right side of the screen.  In order to produce an overall score for the pillar, the weights are constrained to sum to 1.  

Countries shaded in dark orange are the lowest performing, countries in dark green are the highest performing. Countries are grouped into five groups:
 

* **Top Quintile**:  Countries in the Top quintile are classified in this group.  Shading in <span style="color:#2ec4b6">dark green</span>.    
* **4th Quintile**: Countries in the 4th quintile, or those above the 60th percentile but below the 80th percentile are in this group.  Shading in <span style="color:#acece7">light green</span>.    
* **3rd Quintile**: Countries in the 3rd quintile, or those between the 40th and 60th percentile, are classified in this group.  Shading in <span style="color:#f1dc76">yellow</span>.  
* **2nd Quintile**: Countries in the 2nd quintile, or those above the 20th percentile but below the 40th percentile, are in this group.  Shading in <span style="color:#ffbf69">light orange</span>.  
* **Bottom 20%**: Countries in the bottom 20% are classified in this group.  Shading in <span style="color:#ff9f1c">dark orange </span>.
