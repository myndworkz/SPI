# Statistical Performance Indicators

National statistical systems are facing significant challenges. These challenges arise from increasing demands for high quality and trustworthy data to guide decision making, coupled with the rapidly changing landscape of the data revolution. To help create a mechanism for learning amongst national statistical systems, the World Bank has developed improved Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) to monitor the statistical performance of countries. The SPI focuses on five key dimensions of a countryâ€™s statistical performance: (i) data use, (ii) data services, (iii) data products, (iv) data sources, and (v) data infrastructure.  This will replace the Statistical Capacity Index (SCI) that the World Bank has regularly published since 2004. 

## How to use this tool
The Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) framework is designed to capture different aspects of national statistical capacity by employing most relevant and representative
variables that are publicly available. The SPI can be used to gauge
statistical performance of individual countries over time or
cross-country comparisons of performance at a point in time.

This application allows users to explore the Statistical Performance Index and the indicators that populate it.  

The first tab in the application, Global Picture, shows a map of the overall index score, along with scores for each indicator, dimension, or pillar.

In the second tab, the user can explore details for each country as well by selecting the "Country Reports" tab.

In the final tab, the user can view a table with the overall scores for each country.  Users also have the capability of adjusting weights to put greater emphasis on certain dimensions or pillars.
